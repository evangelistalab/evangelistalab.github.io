            <h1>Talks</h1>
            <p>Here is a link to a YouTube video of a talk that Francesco gave at the Institute for Pure & Applied
                Mathematics (IPAM) at UCLA as part of a workshop on Model Reduction in Quantum Mechanics. In this talk,
                Francesco discusses how our group makes models (effective Hamiltonians) of electrons in molecular
                systems using the similarity renormalization group. The talk discusses some of the challenges of
                creating effective Hamiltonians and it introduces the basics of the driven similarity renormalization
                group (DSRG) formalism developed in our research group. If you find the talk useful, you could follow up
                by reading a review of the DSRG (C. Li, F.A. Evangelista, <i>Ann. Rev.
                    Phys. Chem.</i> <strong>70</strong>, 245, 2019).</p>
