            <p>We are a research group in theoretical chemistry. If you are curious about our group’s research you might
                want to poke around in our research page or check out our latest <a
                    href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-Fh9YDIAAAAJ">publications</a>. Our focus is
                the
                development
                of new electronic structure methods to address chemical phenomena that are not well understood.</p>

            <p>We are always interested in recruiting new talented graduate students interested in the development and
                application of electronic structure methods. If you have a background in physical chemistry, physics,
                math,
                applied math, or computer programming, we encourage you to apply to Emory’s PhD program or contact
                Francesco
                directly. Information about Emory’s Chemistry PhD program (including the link to apply on-line) can be
                found
                <a href="https://chemistry.emory.edu/home/graduate/index.html">here</a>.
