                <h1>Multireference electronic structure theory</h1>
                <p>An important open problem in computational chemistry is predicting the energy and properties of
                    open-shell species, intermediates that are formed during bond-breaking processes, excited states,
                    and spin states of transition metal compounds.</p>
                <p>Our group has developed new <em>multireference</em> theories based on the driven similarity
                    renormalization group (DSRG). The strategy followed by the DSRG is to map all the electrons in a
                    molecule to a small set of valence electrons that experience "renormalized" effective interaction.
                    The DSRG effectively removes the orbitals responsible for weak (dynamical) correlation, greatly
                    simplifying the problem of solving the Schr√∂dinger equation. We have developed the DSRG in many
                    directions, including low-cost methods for large molecule, high-accuracy methods, excited state
                    methods, and have recently started to combine the DSRG with <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

                <p>Our group also develops new methods to treat the strong (static) correlation. Traditional quantum
                    chemistry methods typically assume some form of structure for the wave function. Methods built on
                    this premise are computationally efficient, but are not sufficiently flexible to accurately compute
                    near-degenerate electronic states. We have focused in particular on using selected configuration
                    interaction (sCI), an approach that reduces the cost of computations by exploiting the sparsity of
                    the wave function. This line of work led to the development of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

                <h1>Quantum computing and machine learning</h1>
                <p>Quantum computers perform computations using the principles of quantum mechanics. For example, while
                    a classical computer can process a certain amount of bits (0s and 1s) at a time, a quantum computer
                    can perform operations on a superposition of all possible configurations of bits. This feature gives
                    quantum computers a great advantage in many applications, including the simulation of quantum
                    mechanics. Our group has recently started to work on new quantum computing algorithms. We are part
                    and lead a multi-investigator effort to create quantum algorithms for solving challenging electron
                    correlation problems. As part of this project we have studied <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

                        cluster theory</a> for quantum computing. We have also proposed a <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

                    strongly correlated electrons based on real-time evolution of the wave function.
                </p>
                <p>We are also interested in exploring ways to employ machine learning techniques to create better
                    quantum algorithms. This is work is just starting.</p>

                <h1>X-ray spectroscopy and dynamics</h1>
                <p>X-ray spectroscopy offers a powerful and unique approach to probe the local environment and
                    electronic structure in an element-specific way. We are developing several approaches to compute
                    core-excited states probed in X-ray absorption spectroscopies. Our initial work focused on
                    developing an orthogonality-constrained DFT (OC-DFT) scheme <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
                        href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C4CP05509H" target="_blank">for core-excited states</a>, which
                    we combined with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00817"
                        target="_blank">relativistic Hamiltonians</a>. We have also developed methods to <a

                    function methods to compute core-excited states that employ a combination of the DSRG and ACI.</p>
                <p>Another area that we have explored is simulating the dynamics of electrons following a core
                    excitations. We have recently developed a time-dependent version of the adaptive CI and applied to
                    study <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5126945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charge
